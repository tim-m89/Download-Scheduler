It works by briefly connecting to the server of each URL upon scheduling in order to follow HTTP redirects and to obtain 'content disposition' headers so that the target file name default can be inferred with greater accuracy. This feature was previously only enabled but is now a custom setting that is disabled by default since it is not desirable for everyone.">
